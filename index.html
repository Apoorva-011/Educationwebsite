    <p class="s">The Right to Education‚Äù act was passed in 2009, which specified that those children between 6-14 ages, will be given free education and all necessary things. Many other initiatives have been started by the Government to ensure that there is increase in the literacy rate in India. Today, literacy rate in India is at 74.04%. More efforts are still being made and finally there will be a day in future when illiteracy in India will be completely non-existent.The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers. The worst illiterate is the political illiterate, he doesn't hear, doesn't speak, nor participates in the political events.</p></div>
